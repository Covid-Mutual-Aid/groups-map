        <p>FAQ:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can I edit my group info?</li>
          <p>
            Yes! Find your group in the sidebar and click the {icons('more')} icon on the top right
            corner and select edit group from the dropdown. Submit your email and check your inbox
            for further instructions üôÇ.
          </p>
          <li>Is my personal data safe?</li>
          <p>
            While your group information is public, the email addresses you provide are not. We care
            a lot about privacy and will not disclose this without your written consent.
          </p>
          <li>Can you help me find my group?</li>
          <p>
            If you send us an email we will do our best to help, but we hope you find this easier
            after the recent redesign!
          </p>
