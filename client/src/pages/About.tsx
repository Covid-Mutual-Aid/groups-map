        <p>FAQ:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can I edit my group info?</li>
          <p>
            Yes! Find your group in the sidebar, click the {icons('more')} icon on the top right
            corner and select edit group from the dropdown. Submit your email and check your inbox
            for further instructions üôÇ.
          </p>
          <li>Can I report a group?</li>
          <p>
            Yes, click the {icons('more')} icon on the top right corner and select report group from
            the dropdown. Once you have completed the form, we will review your report and remove
            the group if we deem it appropriate. We will usually remove the group if it is a link to
            an individual, spam or promotional, no longer accesible or spreading hate
            speech/misinformation.
          </p>
          <li>Is my personal data safe?</li>
          <p>
            While your group information is public, the email addresses you provide are not. We care
            a lot about privacy and will not disclose this without your written consent.
          </p>
          <li>Can you help me find my group?</li>
          <p>
            If you send us an email we will do our best to help, but we hope you find this easier
            after the recent redesign!
          </p>
          <li>Why can't I add more information to my group?</li>
